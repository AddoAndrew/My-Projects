# Project Portfolio
School Projects Portfolio This repository contains a collection of my school projects, completed as part of my coursework at the University of California, Stockton. The projects showcase my skills in engineering, programming, problem-solving, and teamwork.

**School  Projects**

1. **Optimal Design of Vertical Machining Center Structure**

**Objective**: To optimize a vertical CNC machining center's structure, increasing rigidity by 40% while preserving mass and dimensions using SolidWorks and FE analysis.

•	Conducted a topology study using SolidWorks to identify critical areas for material optimization.

•	Performed static stress analysis to evaluate structural integrity and performance.

•	3D printed the optimized design and presented results to the class in a presentation.



2. **Design, Assembly, and Operation of a CNC 3-Axis Plotter**

**Objective**: To design, assemble, and operate a CNC 3-axis plotter by integrating hardware components, configuring compatible software

•	Assembled all hardware components to construct the CNC 3-axis plotter.

•	Operated the plotter using "Engraver Master" software to execute precise drawing functions.

•	Demonstrated the plotter's functionality in a class presentation by successfully drawing a figure.



**Design, and Manufacturing of a Gearbox Using SolidWorks, and CNC Machining**

**Objective**: To design, and manufacture a gearbox (top cover, housing, and side cover) using SolidWorks, CNC machining for fabrication. 

•	Designed the gearbox using SolidWorks.

•	Generated machining processes using Esprit software to create toolpaths for CNC operations.

•	Machined the parts using a HAAS CNC machine, ensuring precision and quality in fabrication.



**3D FDM printer design and development**

**Objective**: To design, develop, and fabricate a functional 3D FDM printer by repurposing an existing CNC machine frame and controller

•	Assembled the CNC machine frame to serve as the foundation for the 3D printer.

•	Designed, purchased, and manufactured additional components required to repurpose the CNC machine into a functional 3D printer.

•	Assembled all parts, including the frame, extruder, hotend, and build plate, to create a complete 3D printer.

•	Operated the 3D printer using Repetier-Host software to successfully print sample parts.
